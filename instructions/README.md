# ⚠️ Before you start
* This app requires that you have a Google account to use it;
* A know caveat of this project is the lack of testing and lack of security layer to store API keys. **DON'T** commit your API keys to your repository.
* Have a extra care with these following files:
  * `src/config/keys.json`: create this file just copying the `src/config/TEMPLATE.keys.json` content.
  * `app.json`: Change *expo.android.package* value **BEFORE** creating a new apk. This package name will be use in both Firebase Console and Google Credentials.

## Create a new Firebase Project

1. Create a new project from [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

![Create project](1.png)

2. To get yours fingerprints, type `expo fetch:android:hashes` on your console. This should look like this:

```
$ expo fetch:android:hashes
Accessing credentials for USER in project precos-do-mercadinho
Google Certificate Fingerprint:     GOOGLE API & SERVICES FINGERPRINTS
Google Certificate Hash (SHA-1):    XXX
Google Certificate Hash (SHA-256):  XXX
Facebook Key Hash:                  XXX
```

>❗ If this commands returns that it cannot get its hashes, generate an aux build with `expo build:android -t apk` then try to generate the fingerprints again.


## Firebase Web App keys

1. Visit [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

2.  Select the Firebase Web app, follow the instructions and copy the API keys values.

3. Paste these values to `src/config/keys.json`. This file should now look like this:
```json
{
  "apiKey": "FIREBASE KEY",
  "authDomain": "FIREBASE KEY",
  "databaseURL": "FIREBASE KEY",
  "projectId": "FIREBASE KEY",
  "storageBucket": "FIREBASE KEY",
  "messagingSenderId": "FIREBASE KEY",
  "appId": "FIREBASE KEY",
  "measurementId": "FIREBASE KEY",
  "androidClientId": ""
}
```

## Google Credentials keys

1. Visit [Google API & Services](https://console.developers.google.com), access the **Credentials** menu and create an OAuth Client ID.

![Create credentials](5.png)

2. Get the **package name** from `app.json` and the *GOOGLE API & SERVICES FINGERPRINTS* from the previous step and fill the form that will show up.

3. After that, it will copy your Android Client ID.

4. Paste this id into your `config/src/keys.json`. Now this file should be look like this:

```json
{
  "apiKey": "FIREBASE KEY",
  "authDomain": "FIREBASE KEY",
  "databaseURL": "FIREBASE KEY",
  "projectId": "FIREBASE KEY",
  "storageBucket": "FIREBASE KEY",
  "messagingSenderId": "FIREBASE KEY",
  "appId": "FIREBASE KEY",
  "measurementId": "FIREBASE KEY",
  "androidClientId": "GOOGLE KEY"
}
```

## Google Services file

1. Create a Android app from Firebase console, where the package name **must be** exactly what it is in your `app.json` file. There is no need to put fingerprints, so leave it blank. After that, download the `google-services.json` file. The final directory structure should be like this:
```
  .
  ├── ...                    
  ├── src
      ├── ...
      ├── config
          ├── keys.json
      ├── ...               
  ├── .gitignore                    
  ├── app.json              
  ├── App.tsx
  ├── babel.config.js
  ├── google-services.json
  ├── package.json
  ├── README.md
  └── tsconfig.json
```

## Firebase services

This project uses Firebase authentication and Realtime Database.


### Authentication

1. To enable authentication, navigate to **Sign-in method** menu and enable **Google**.

![Authentication](11.png)

2. Add your Android Client ID (from Google Services) to the safelist.

![Add to safelist](13.png)

### Database

1. Press **Create Database** button and create one in **locked mode**.

![Database](12.png)

2. After created, navigate to **Rules** menu and specified who should read and write in your database. My suggestion is to enable some functionalities just for some users, in hard-coded mode (I think is easier, but this is one of the caveats of this projects).

```json
{
  "rules": {
      ".write": "auth.uid == 'UID1' || auth.uid === 'UID2'",
      ".read": "auth.uid == 'UID1' || auth.uid === 'UID2'"
  }
}
```
To get this UID, you can check the Firebase Authentication menu after the user has signed in.

## Generating the android app

You can generate a ``apk`` file with the following command at your console:
```sh
expo build:android -t apk
```
It will take a while to generate, but, once is finished, your console should show theses messages

```
$ expo build:android -t apk
